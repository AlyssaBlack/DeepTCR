     |      Clustering Sequences by Latent Features
     |      
     |      This method clusters all sequences by learned latent features from
     |      either the VAE or the GAN. Hierarchical clustering is implemented
     |      from the scipy package.
     |      
     |      Inputs
     |      ---------------------------------------
     |      
     |      clustering_method: str
     |          Clustering algorithm to use to cluster TCR sequences. Options include
     |          phenograph, dbscan, or hierarchical. When using dbscan or hierarchical clustering,
     |          a variety of thresholds are used to find an optimimum silhoutte score before using a final
     |          clustering threshold when t value is not provided.
     |      
     |      t: float
     |          If t is provided, this is used as a distance threshold for hierarchical clustering or the eps
     |          value for dbscan.
     |      
     |      criterion: str
     |          Clustering criterion as allowed by fcluster function

     |          Additionally, if set to True, a csv file will be written in results directory that contains the frequency contribution
     |          of each cluster to each sample.
     |      
     |      sample: int
     |          For large numbers of sequences, to obtain a faster clustering solution, one can sub-sample
     |          a number of sequences and then use k-nearest neighbors to assign other sequences.
     |      
     |      n_jobs:int

     |      type_of_data_cut: str
     |          Method by which one wants to sample from the TCRSeq File.
     |      
     |          Options are:
     |              Fraction_Response: A fraction (0 - 1) that samples the top fraction of the file by reads. For example,
     |              if one wants to sample the top 25% of reads, one would use this threshold with a data_cut = 0.25. The idea
     |              of this sampling is akin to sampling a fraction of cells from the file.
     |      
     |              Frequency_Cut: If one wants to select clones above a given frequency threshold, one would use this threshold.
     |              For example, if one wanted to only use clones about 1%, one would enter a data_cut value of 0.01.
     |      
     |              Num_Seq: If one wants to take the top N number of clones, one would use this threshold. For example,
     |              if one wanted to select the top 10 amino acid clones from each file, they would enter a data_cut value of 10.
     |      
     |              Read_Cut: If one wants to take amino acid clones with at least a certain number of reads, one would use
     |              this threshold. For example, if one wanted to only use clones with at least 10 reads,they would enter a data_cut value of 10.
     |      
     |              Read_Sum: IF one wants to take a given number of reads from each file, one would use this threshold. For example,
     |              if one wants to use the sequences comprising the top 100 reads of hte file, they would enter a data_cut value of 100.
     |

     |      within a given cluster. Then a distance metric is used to compare how far two samples are
     |      based on their cluster proportions. Various metrics can be provided here such as KL-divergence,
