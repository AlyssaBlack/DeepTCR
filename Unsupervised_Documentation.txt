     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  Cluster(self, t=100, criterion='distance', on=None, write_to_sheets=False, method='ward', metric='euclidean')
     |      Clustering Sequences by Latent Features
     |      
     |      This method clusters all sequences by learned latent features from
     |      either the VAE or the GAN. Hierarchical clustering is implemented
     |      from the scipy package.
     |      
     |      Inputs
     |      ---------------------------------------
     |      
     |      t: float/int
     |          Threshold parameter for clustering algorithm
     |      
     |      criterion: str
     |          Clustering criterion as allowed by fcluster function
     |          in scipy.cluster.hierarchy module.
     |      
     |      write_to_sheets: bool
     |          To write clusters to separate csv files in folder named 'Clusters' under results folder, set to True.
     |          Additionally, if set to True, a csv file will be written in results directory that contains the frequency contribution
     |          of each cluster to each sample.
     |      
     |      on: str
     |          Specificy which feature space to cluster on. Options are 'VAE','GAN','Both',None. If nothing is specified, the

     |          the feature space from both unsupervised algorithms before clustering.

     |      type_of_data_cut: str
     |          Method by which one wants to sample from the TCRSeq File.
     |      
     |          Options are:
     |              Fraction_Response: A fraction (0 - 1) that samples the top fraction of the file by reads. For example,
     |              if one wants to sample the top 25% of reads, one would use this threshold with a data_cut = 0.25. The idea
     |              of this sampling is akin to sampling a fraction of cells from the file.
     |      
     |              Frequency_Cut: If one wants to select clones above a given frequency threshold, one would use this threshold.
     |              For example, if one wanted to only use clones about 1%, one would enter a data_cut value of 0.01.
     |      
     |              Num_Seq: If one wants to take the top N number of clones, one would use this threshold. For example,
     |              if one wanted to select the top 10 amino acid clones from each file, they would enter a data_cut value of 10.
     |      
     |              Read_Cut: If one wants to take amino acid clones with at least a certain number of reads, one would use
     |              this threshold. For example, if one wanted to only use clones with at least 10 reads,they would enter a data_cut value of 10.
     |      
     |              Read_Sum: IF one wants to take a given number of reads from each file, one would use this threshold. For example,
     |              if one wants to use the sequences comprising the top 100 reads of hte file, they would enter a data_cut value of 100.
     |      
     |      data_cut: float or int
     |          Value  associated with type_of_data_cut parameter.
     |      
     |      n_jobs: int
     |          Number of processes to use for parallelized operations.

     |      
     |      aa_column_beta: int
     |          Column where beta chain amino acid data is stored.(0-indexed)
     |      
     |      If both column integers are left to None, column with a header containing 'acid' is used as
     |          the amino acid column.
     |      
     |      count_column: int
     |          Column where counts are stored. If set to None, first column with data in integer datatype is used as the
     |          counts column.
     |      
     |      sep: str
     |          Type of delimiter used in file with TCRSeq data.
     |      
     |      aggregate_by_aa: bool
     |          Choose to aggregate sequences by unique amino-acid. Defaults to True. If set to False, will allow duplicates
     |          of the same amino acid sequence given it comes from different nucleotide clones.
