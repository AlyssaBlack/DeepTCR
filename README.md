# DeepTCR

Deep Learning Methods for Parsing T-Cell Receptor Sequencing (TCRSeq) Data

DeepTCR is a python package that has a collection of unsupervsied and supervised 
deep learning approaches to parse TCRSeq data. To see an example of how the algorithms can 
be used on an example dataset, see Tutorial.ipnyb. 

DeepTCR has the following python library dependencies:
1. numpy==1.14.5
2. pandas==0.23.1
3. tensorflow
4. glob
5. scikit-learn==0.19.1
6. pickleshare==0.7.4
7. matplotlib==2.2.2
8. scipy==1.1.0
9. biopython==1.69
10. seaborn==0.9.0


In order to install DeepTCR, run setup script:
